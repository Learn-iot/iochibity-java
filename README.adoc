Java API/SDK for Iotivity

WARNING: The makefile is very much a Work-In-Progress. If you have
trouble you'll havve to read it and figure out what to adjust. It
should be pretty simple: compile some C++ code, then some java
code. You just have to point to the right header files and library
paths.

This is the Java API and JNI wrapper code for Iotivity, broken out
into a stand-alone project.  It is derived from work by Petre Eftime
(https://gerrit.iotivity.org/gerrit/#/c/7895/[patch 7895]).

The examples were originally for use with the Android port, but only
two (simpleclient and simpleserver) have been ported to work with the
Java SDK.

Makefiles for the example code have not yet been written. But it
should be easy to compile them, just run an ordinary `javac` command.
You don't need the Gradle stuff, it will eventually be removed.

See also https://github.com/iotk/iotivity-clj[iotk/iotivity-clj],
which is a Clojure SDK for Iotivity, built on this Java SDK.
